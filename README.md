## German Traffic Sign Classifier Project 
### 2nd project assignment in SDC nanodegree
## Author
Zak Keirn Ph.D.
### Notes
I submitted the markdown version of the write up as a zip file. Not sure this is what we are supposed to do or not. I could not find a way to create a pdf of the writeup from the ipynb file succesfully.  I could not find anything in the forums on this so posted a question. I figured I could submit in the meantime and hopefully this is ok. 
#### Update
I added discussion on the images grabbed from the web per the reviewer feedback. Ready for resubmit
